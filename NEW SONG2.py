Frame 1:
A glowing cluster of orbs floats in the air, each shimmering with light. 
Wisps of sparkling energy trail between them, twisting and dancing like tiny
streams of electricity. Beneath the orbs, tall columns of light rise from the 
ground, giving the scene depth, as if a mysterious city of light is forming in 
the darkness.


Frame 2:
The glowing orbs drift slightly apart, leaving sparkling trails that crisscross
the air. The energy between them pulses rhythmically, like a heartbeat. 
The vertical pillars shimmer and stretch taller, casting faint light onto an 
invisible ground below. The atmosphere feels alive, as if the scene itself 
is breathing.

Frame 3:
The orbs begin to spin slowly around a central point, their trails forming looping 
arcs of light. The vertical pillars bend slightly as if swaying in an unseen wind,
adding a sense of motion. Tiny sparks drift downward, like glowing dust settling 
from the air.

Frame 4:
The orbs merge closer together, their light intensifying and casting a warm glow 
across the scene. The energy trails now form intricate patterns, weaving between 
the pillars. The atmosphere feels magical, almost like a ritual of light taking place.

Frame 5 (Last Frame):
The orbs rise upward, leaving behind faint shimmering streaks.
The pillars slowly dim, and the energy trails fade, leaving only
a soft glow in the darkness. The scene gently settles, as if the 
spectacle has completed and the light has whispered itself away.




------------------------------
In a dark, endless space, a cluster of glowing orbs floated in the air, shimmering with 
a mysterious light. Wisps of sparkling energy twisted and danced between them like tiny
streams of electricity. Beneath the orbs, tall pillars of light rose from the ground, 
giving the scene depth, as if a hidden city of light was forming in the darkness.


The orbs drifted slightly apart, leaving trails that crisscrossed the air. The energy
between them pulsed rhythmically, like a heartbeat, while the vertical pillars stretched
taller, casting faint light onto the invisible ground below. The scene seemed alive, 
breathing softly with its own rhythm.


Slowly, the orbs began to spin around a central point, their trails forming looping 
arcs of light. The pillars swayed gently, as if moved by an unseen wind, while tiny 
sparks drifted downward like glowing dust settling from the air.


The orbs merged closer together, their glow intensifying, casting a warm radiance 
across the space. Energy trails wove intricate patterns between the pillars, creating
a magical, almost ritualistic atmosphere of light.

Finally, the orbs rose upward, leaving behind faint shimmering streaks. The pillars 
dimmed, and the energy trails slowly faded, leaving only a soft glow lingering in the 
darkness. The spectacle completed itself, and the light whispered quietly away, 
leaving the space calm and serene.
